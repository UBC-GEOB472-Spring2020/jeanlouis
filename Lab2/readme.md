## Breakdown

Understanding how to represent this data and what was significant in the context was quite difficult. Ultimately, I decided to make a map for fishermen, or citizen scientists who may be interested in understanding the distribution of invasive species. I grappled with the consideration of adding Voronoi polygons to try and visualize possible occurrences of each species throughout the channel. I was afraid this would miscategorise the data as being coverage rather than a single point, as a result I did not do this. Instead I kept the focus on clearly labeled individual points. As one shifts through the species it is clear to see where clusters may exist, and easily click each point to expand and understand other species present at each site. This process is quick, intuitive and allow for a deeper connection with the data, all of which seen as significant facors when designing interactive maps (Roth, 2015) <br>

The interactive elements are clear and intuitive, as well as easy to read. They provide excellent context to the map, and allow for better pinch and zoom capabilities as there are no options for hovering. (23) (Muehlenhaus, 2014) The symbols are also kept simple, in the shape of a flag, and project the purpose of a “station” effectively. In fact, the simplicity of the flag with the arrow conveys the point that data of some sort exists within, better than perhaps a more specific symbol might (141)( Muehlenhaus, 2014)

## Collaboraion Session


Through collaboration multiple factors came to mind. The basemap was originally dark and did not put enough emphasis on the water. Further the symbols were only symbols. The GeoJSON data from the departent of fisheries did not contain percent cover of invasive species. If this was provided the use of circles instead of symbols may be useful. Thus in both cases I shifted my map to better account for the specifics of the data.
